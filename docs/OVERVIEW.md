## Project Overview

Tidal Island is a survival game where the player is stranded on a deserted island and must gather resources and craft items to escape. The player progresses toward building a raft to escape the island before the tides get too high and submerge the island\!

Note: a [tidal island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_island) is a raised area of land within a waterbody that is exposed at low tide and submerged at high tide.
